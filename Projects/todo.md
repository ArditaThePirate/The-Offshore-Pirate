Write notes on [The Design of Everyday Things]() and [Emotional Design]() by Don Norman, as well as [Rocket Surgey Made Easy]() by Steve Krug. 

**Strategy**: Don't read books front to back. Jump around frequently based on what I'm currently working on with side projects.

In addition, I want to develop competency in [Figma](), [Sketch](), and/or [FrameX]().
